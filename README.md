This project includes features such as:
・ Auto-scrolling triggered by a button
・ Form validation with phone mask.
・ Instead of relying on libraries like Bootstrap, all styles are created with pure code, including custom checkboxes. This approach allows UX/UI to fully unleash its potential, resulting in a better user experience and a unique style for the business.
Below, I’ve highlighted a few aspects of the project that I’d like to share with you.

Adaptive Callouts
Adaptive callouts are implemented to adjust based on screen width. On smaller screens, these linear callouts transform into clickable points, ensuring a clean and aesthetic appearance. This solution guarantees a visually harmonious layout across all devices, starting from 320px.

Custom carousel
The carousel is the gem of this project, built entirely from scratch without any libraries. Its unique shape and animation are one of a kind, making it stand out. Additionally, the carousel is fully adaptive, transforming on smaller screens to enhance user experience.
